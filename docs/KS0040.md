## 1. Introduction

This analog gas sensor - MQ2 is used in gas leakage detecting equipment in consumer electronics and industrial markets.

This sensor is suitable for detecting LPG, I-butane, propane, methane, alcohol, Hydrogen and smoke. It has high sensitivity and quick response.

In addition, the sensitivity can be adjusted by rotating the potentiometer. 

## 2. Specification

- Power Supply: 5V
- Interface Type: Analog
- Wide detecting scope
- Quick response and High sensitivity
- Simple drive circuit
- Stable and long lifespan

## 4. Sample Code

Download Code:  [Code](./Code.7z)

```
void setup()
{
	Serial.begin(9600); //Set serial baud rate to 9600 bps
}

void loop()
{
    int val;
    val=analogRead(0);//Read Gas value from analog 0
    Serial.println(val,DEC);//Print the value to serial port
    delay(100);
}
```

## 5. Result
